Uses the spin Hamiltonian theory for isotropic liquid 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. See Ernst's "Principles of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance in One and Two Dimensions" (ISBN 0-19-855647-0) and Levitt's "Spin Dynamics" (ISBN 978-0-470-51117-6) for the theory.

## To Install:
Since the pre-requisite packages are not registered with the Julia public registry, you must manually install them first.
From the Julia REPL, type `]` then `add https://github.com/AI4DBiological-Systems/GISSMOReader`
We will officially register the pre-requisite packages with JuliaHub once we publish our work, so that this manual step won't be needed.

## Layout of As. (documentation in progress)
 Describe what the field names of As[i] are, and the front end functions that calls them.
 
## Examples (in progress)
In the example folder. We will use Weave.jl to convert the existing example scripts there to something more along the lines of an user-friendly tutorial.
